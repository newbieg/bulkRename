# bulkRename
A collection of rename tools that work on all files in a folder
If using qtcreator, copy the tool you wish to build to main.cpp before running the pro file.

## List of tools
1. Remove Letter: 
  - Drop all instances of a character from all file names in the current folder.  - Use a double escape sequence if you're rmoving one of these: "\\\#$*", other escape characters, and or function keys.

2. RemoveWord:
  - Same as RemoveLetter, but will replace all instances of a full word in the file names.
